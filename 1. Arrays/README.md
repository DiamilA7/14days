# 14-Day Array Mastery Challenge

**Objective**  
Solve and document **25 Array problems in 14 days**, focusing on correctness, clarity, and explanation quality.

This challenge is **pass/fail**. Weak explanations invalidate the entire task.


## Rules

- Total problems: **25**
- Duration: **14 days**
- Category: **Arrays**
- Every problem must include:
  - Final Solution
  - Explanation (clear enough for a peer to re-derive the solution)
  - Time & Space Complexity
  - Mistake Note (what went wrong initially or common pitfalls)


## Verification

- A peer randomly selects **5 problems** from the repository
- The peer reads **only the explanation**
- If they **cannot fully understand or reproduce the logic**, the challenge **fails**
- Code correctness alone is **not sufficient**
